	[FEATURES]
	- added 'no_wide_chars' option to strip words with such characters
	  from the output.  This may help spellcheckers that can't cope
	  with UTF-8

	  isolation (example C<< "hello". >> now is found as "hello")
	- strips all word that do not have at least one \w character

1.09      2013-09-25
	[FIXED]
	- stopwords with 's are learned without 's to match how they are
	  checked
	[CHANGED]
	- leading and trailing punctuation is entirely stripped since the
	  spellchecker won't care anyway.  Trailing periods are *not*
	  stripped as they might be abbreviations ("Ph.D."), but such words
	  are checked against the stoplist both with and without
	  trailing periods to account for abbreviations and words at the
	  end of a sentence.
