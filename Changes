    - releasing as stable

1.22      2022-08-29 (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - fix finding wordlist when not run against files directly in lib/

1.21      2022-08-24 (TRIAL RELEASE)
    - port to use Pod::Simple rather than Pod::Parser
    - use File::Spec rather than Path::Tiny

1.19_91   2016-04-21
    - Drop use of File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir (GitHub #26). Thanks Kent
      Fredric!
    - Allow stop words with '.' (GitHub #28). Thanks Paulo Custodio!

1.19_90   2016-02-20
    - Hide internals: the POD parser is moved to a private package and
      the Pod::Spell package now only exposes the public interface.
      This is a first step towards rewriting the parser using Pod::Simple
      (planned for Pod-Spell-2.0).
    - 'parse_from_file' and 'parse_from_filehandle' are now explicitely
      documented (by copying doc from Pod::Parser).

1.19      2016-02-20
    - Don't set $Text::Wrap::huge globally, but localize it
    - Load Pod::Wordlist only if used

1.18      2016-01-30
    - New maintainer: Olivier MenguÃ© (DOLMEN)
      Repo is now hosted at github.com/perl-pod/Pod-Spell
    - Fix warning in strip_stopwords (GH #23)
    - re-apply "podspell script: set output encoding from locale CTYPE"
      (GH #22, #17). The issue in 1.16 was an incorrect dependency
      on I18N::Langinfo.

1.17      2015-03-08
    - revert changes in 1.16 they are not compatible with windows GH #18

    - Convert to strict mode of File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir (KENTNL)
    - change to use Path::Tiny->lines_utf8

1.11      2013-10-17
    - fix shebang to /usr/bin/perl for EUMM replacment GH #13 (dolmen)

1.10      2013-09-27
    [FEATURES]
    - added 'no_wide_chars' option to strip words with such characters
      from the output.  This may help spellcheckers that can't cope
      with UTF-8
    [CHANGED]
    - improved punctuation stripping algorithm for better word
      isolation (example C<< "hello". >> now is found as "hello")
    - strips all word that do not have at least one \w character
      as a spellchecker isn't likely to do anything useful with them
    [DOCUMENTED]
    - added recommendations for dealing with character encoding

1.09      2013-09-25
    [FIXED]
    - stopwords with 's are learned without 's to match how they are
      checked
    [CHANGED]
    - leading and trailing punctuation is entirely stripped since the
      spellchecker won't care anyway.  Trailing periods are *not*
      stripped as they might be abbreviations ("Ph.D."), but such words
      are checked against the stoplist both with and without
      trailing periods to account for abbreviations and words at the
      end of a sentence.

1.08      2013-09-24
    [FIXED]
    - hyphenated word parts are also checked against the stoplist
      and stripped (dagolden) GH #9
    [DOCUMENTED]
    - noted that stopwords must be added before words appear in Pod

1.07      2013-09-14
    - add many words
    [FEATURES]
    - Pod::Wordlist is an Object ( dagolden )

      ( dagolden )
    - the wordlist is now a sharedir file
    [DEPRECATED]
    - accessing %Pod::Wordlist::Wordlist directly

1.06      2013-09-08
